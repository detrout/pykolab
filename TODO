- consider using ldap.async and ldap.resiter for large results
- iterate multi-domain by DNS domain name (???)
- enable ldap to seek out different ldap trees (in _connect(domain) search for domain/uri,bind_dn, etc keys?)
- delegation control
- reduce bind_dn privilege abuse (e.g. read-only service account when only read-only operations are being executed, read-write but not directory manager / root, ...)
- thread multi-domain / large deployments
- provide configuration settings for multi-domain
- thread large directory trees
- figure out why ldap queries seem to hang with large numbers of users
- when applying a recipient policy, enable mailboxes to be renamed rather then deleted and created

- stop setting quota if the new quota and the current quota are the same (currently the case on the secondary domain)
- users' inbox folders for the secondaary domain are being deleted during the iteration for the first domain?
