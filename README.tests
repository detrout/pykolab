== /!\ Test Execution /!\ ==

Do NOT execute the tests against a production environment.

In case you've missed the previous statement;

Do NOT execute the tests against a production environment.

Why not:

  - the test suites re-initialize your environment without regard to any
    existing data whatsoever.

== To Execute Tests ==

A configuration section [testing] can be added to /etc/kolab/kolab.conf, which
may contain the following key/value pairs:

  admin_login = "string"

    Set this to the login name of a (global, cross-domain) Cyrus IMAP manager.

  admin_password = "string"

    This would be... the password for the aforementioned login.

  server = "hostname-or-ip-address"

    A server we can execute the testing against.

  users = [ ]

    A list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing one user with the
    following attributes:

      givenname
      sn
      domain
      password

    All tests assume %(givenname)s@%(domain)s as the email address corresponding
    to the user.

    Don't forget that using different domains for the users implies you have set
    up the Kolab server accordingly.

Now that you have this information, the following might just start testing;

  python ./kolabtest.py --debug 9 --conf /path/to/conf --suite zpush --use-imap

== Writing Test Suites ==

A Test Suite has a title such as "zpush" which then becomes a pykolab.tests
module. This Test Suite will contain a number of test series (000 through 999),
each of which contains tests (numbered 000 through 999).

Each Test Suite will (need to) have a file

  "pykolab/tests/%s/__init__.py" %(name.tolower())

defining a

  "class %sTest" %(name.capitalize())

such as in the example here:

  http://git.kolabsys.com/pykolab.git/tree/pykolab/tests/zpush/__init__.py#n30

Creating an object from the class should immediately start loading tests and
executing them.

Tests themselves are stored in separate files;

  - test_000_000.py with class Test_000_000

  The 000 test in each series (in this case series 000) will *initialize* the
  environment. That means: Delete all mailboxes, create all mailboxes, set
  annotations and such and so forth.
